# Changelog Generator - v0.6.0

`changelog-gen` is a CHANGELOG generator intended to be used in conjunction
with [bumpversion](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version) to generate
changelogs and create release tags.

## Installation

```bash
pip install changelog-gen
```

or clone this repo and install with poetry, currently depends on poetry < 1.0.0
due to other personal projects being stuck.

```bash
poetry install
```

## Usage

`changelog-gen` currently only supports reading changes from a `release_notes` folder.

Files in the folder should use the format `{issue_number}.{type}`.

By default supported types are currently `fix` and `feat`. Additional types can be configured
to map to these initial types.

The contents of each file is used to populate the changelog file. If the type
ends with a `!` it denotes a breaking change has been made, this will lead to a
major release being suggested.

```bash
$ ls release_notes
  4.fix  7.fix

$ changelog-gen

## v0.2.1

### Bug fixes

- Raise errors from internal classes, don't use click.echo() [#4]
- Update changelog line format to include issue number at the end. [#7]

Write CHANGELOG for suggested version 0.2.1 [y/N]: y
```

## Configuration

Of the command line arguments, most of them can be configured in `setup.cfg` to remove
the need to pass them in every time.

Example `setup.cfg`:

```ini
[changelog_gen]
commit = true
release = true
allow_dirty = false
```

### Configuration file -- Global configuration

#### `allow_dirty = (True | False)`
  _**[optional]**_<br />
